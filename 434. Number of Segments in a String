Count the number of segments in a string, where a segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.
Please note that the string does not contain any non-printable characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello, my name is John"
Output: 5
Explanation: The five segments are ["Hello,", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
Example 2:

Input: s = "Hello"
Output: 1

Solution-1
var countSegments = function (s){
    let count=0,i=0
    while(i<s.length){
        if(s[i]!==" "){
            count++
            while(i<s.length && s[i]!==" "){
                i++
            }
        }
        i++
    }
    return count
}

console.log(countSegments("Hello, my name is John"))
